    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Welcome to our journey. We are a small family rooted in creativity and craftsmanship, blending tradition with innovation. Though originally from West Virginia, life brought us to Chesapeake, VA—where the community, the warmth, and the opportunity to grow sparked something new.

  <!-- Inspiration Section -->
  <section class="container mx-auto p-8 max-w-3xl">
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Inspired by Everyday Moments</h3>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Many of our ideas take shape under the sun at local softball fields, where we watch our kids play the game they love. These quiet moments of reflection and inspiration often become the starting point for our next creation. Whether sketching out designs or reading a good book, each moment adds something to the story behind what we build.

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Crafted with Care</h3>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
      With a strong background in CAD and hands-on woodworking, my husband brings ideas to life with precision and care. Together, we’ve turned a shared passion into a growing business—one that started in our garage and quickly became something more. Each item we create is something we would proudly use in our own home or give as a gift.

      We believe in the power of personalization. Our laser engraving service allows every product to carry a name, a message, or a memory—making it uniquely yours. Whether it's for a special occasion or just because, a customized gift becomes a keepsake that lasts.
